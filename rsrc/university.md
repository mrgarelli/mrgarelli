# Projects

Medical Device Design | [Anatomage](https://www.anatomage.com/table/) | San Jose, CA | 3-6/16
--- | --- | --- | ---
* Investigation of limited design flaw, condensation within virtual dissection tables
* Approach: 
	1. constructed testing facility from refrigerator truck to re-create the issue
	2. built prototypes to prevent condensation
	3. tested the solutions and evaluated the result
* Final solutions included a heat jet applicator and balloon for shipping

Thermal Performance Analysis | University | Stanford, CA | 2-5/16
--- | --- | --- | ---
* Machined and tested a hybrid rocket, HDPE fuel grain in an attempt to maximize the total impulse generated
* Manufactured three fuel grain designs and a converging diverging graphite nozzle
* Analyzed oxidizer-to-fuel mixture ratio, fuel regression rate, and nozzle design to improve total impulse
* Conducted a laboratory fire of a SR30 turbojet engine and collected data for real-process/real-fluid analysis
* Calculated and plotted stagnation temperature, stagnation pressure, Mach number at all states versus spool speed

Bio-inspired Mechanical Systems | University | Stanford, CA | 2/16
--- | --- | --- | ---
* Created a functional tri-pedal kangaroo robot
	* Laser cut four-bar linkages for the legs and tail
	* Laser cut the body and 1:1 sprockets that drove our D-shafts
	* Mapped and analyzed linkage trajectories (plotted in Matlab and tested with working model)

Human Research Study | David Camarillo Lab | Stanford, CA | 1-6/16
--- | --- | --- | ---
* TBI (traumatic brain injury) study
	* Integreted mouth-guards with MEM accelerometers
	* Conducted human testing
	* Analyzed data to determine rotational capabilities of human neck

Robotics Analysis | University | Stanford, CA | 1/16
--- | --- | --- | ---
* Robotics build with the goal to climb a 60 degree incline using a 125:1 gear ratio
* Conducted analysis of the motor efficiency and stress analysis on the weakest gear

Nano Electro-Mechanical System Fabrication Proposal | University | Stanford, CA | 11/15
--- | --- | --- | ---
* Gained understanding (for tech and applications) of NEMS devices by designing a Nano-scale energy harvester
* Optimized power density with respect to frequency; proposed a fabrication process
