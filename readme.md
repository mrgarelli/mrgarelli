# Interests
* Modern compiled languages (like [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/))
    * I build everything I can in Go. The ease of concurrency, proficiency as a systems language, rich set of libraries, strict packaging system, fast build times, and amazing editor support make it an easy choice
    * I would drop everything to learn Rust. Currently 1/3 through [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings). The speed makes it amazing for layer-1 web3 apps, compile time gurantees mean fewer bugs in production, and lack of a garbage collector makes it the ideal choice for web assembly libraries like [yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew)
* Unix Systems, See how [I build Arch from instructions](https://github.com/mrgarelli/InstallArch), and for fun check out [my dotfiles](https://github.com/mrgarelli/unix)
* Data Structures & Algorithms ([leet code!](https://github.com/mrgarelli/dataStructuresAlgorithms))
* Bots ([ping discord from Golang](https://github.com/mrgarelli/chord) | [hot springs reservations](https://github.com/mrgarelli/StrawberryBotSprings) | [ikon reservations](https://github.com/mrgarelli/PowBot))
* Mechanical Design ([internship braden boards](rsrc/design.md))
* Embedded Software ([olkb planck build & flash](https://github.com/nanvenomous/tasty_poison))
